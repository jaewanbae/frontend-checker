### üé® Design notes and trade-offs

- Cache based vs move based undo action. Chose to go with move based action based on memory usage and the business logic of the undo (1 move at a time). If the requirement involved being able to revert to a specific moment in time in the move history, cache based may be more effective.
- Not well supported in mobile. To fully support, would need to remove board labels, additional buttons should be hidden in a collapsible menu.
- Undoing moves made by AI reverts moves until its back to the players turn (2+ moves). Not the best in terms of UX but creates the smoothest play experience when playing against AI
