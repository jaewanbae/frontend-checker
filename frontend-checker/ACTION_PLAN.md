# 🎯 Checkers Game Tech Challenge - Action Plan

## 📋 Project Overview

Build a **ReactJS with TypeScript** application that implements a playable Checkers game in the browser. Focus on clean component design, effective state management, and a pleasant user experience.

## 🗓️ Development Timeline: 6-7 Days

## **Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation (Day 1)**

### 1.1 Initialize React Project

- [x] Create React app with TypeScript template (`npx create-react-app frontend-checker --template typescript`)
- [x] Set up project structure with clear component boundaries
- [x] Configure ESLint, Prettier for code quality
- [x] Set up testing framework (Jest + React Testing Library)

### 1.2 Project Structure Design

- [x] Create all component files with proper structure
- [x] Set up hooks for game logic and state management
- [x] Create utility functions for game mechanics
- [x] Organize test structure

```

### 1.3 Core Type Definitions

- [x] Define game state interfaces (Board, Piece, Player, Game)
- [x] Define move validation types
- [x] Set up enums for piece types, player colors, game states
- [x] Create drag and drop types for Pragmatic Drag and Drop

### 1.4 Dependencies Setup

- [x] Install Pragmatic Drag and Drop (`@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/utilities`)
- [x] Install Styled Components (`styled-components`, `@types/styled-components`)
- [x] Install additional utilities (date-fns for timers, etc.)
- [x] Set up development dependencies

---

## **Phase 2: Core Game Logic (Days 2-3)**

### 2.1 Game State Management

- [x] Implement game state using React hooks (useReducer, useState)
- [ ] Create game logic utilities (separate from UI components)
- [ ] Implement board initialization with standard starting positions
- [ ] Set up game state persistence (localStorage)

### 2.2 Move Validation System

- [ ] Basic diagonal movement validation
- [ ] Jump/capture logic with mandatory capture enforcement
- [ ] Multiple sequential jumps support
- [ ] King movement (forward and backward)
- [ ] Kinging logic when reaching opponent's back row
- [ ] Valid move highlighting system

### 2.3 Game Rules Engine

- [ ] Turn management (alternating players)
- [ ] Win condition detection
- [ ] Move history tracking
- [ ] Game state transitions

---

## **Phase 3: UI Components (Days 3-4)**

### 3.1 Core Components

### 3.2 Pragmatic Drag and Drop Implementation

- [ ] Set up DndContext with collision detection
- [ ] Implement draggable pieces with visual feedback
- [ ] Create drop zones for valid squares
- [ ] Handle drag end events and move validation
- [ ] Add drag preview customization
- [ ] Implement smooth drag animations

### 3.3 User Interaction

- [ ] Click-to-select alternative interaction
- [ ] Visual feedback for valid moves (highlighting)
- [ ] Active player indicator
- [ ] Piece selection highlighting
- [ ] Invalid move feedback

### 3.4 Responsive Design

- [ ] Mobile-friendly layout
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Window resize handling
- [ ] Touch device optimization

---

## **Phase 4: AI & Game Modes (Day 4-5)**
